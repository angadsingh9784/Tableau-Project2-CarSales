# ðŸš— Unveiling My New Tableau Presentation! ðŸš—

I'm excited to share my latest work in data visualization, where I've explored the car sales dataset using Tableau. In this project, I utilized Text Tables, Highlight Tables, and Heat Maps to bring the data to life. Each visualization is accompanied by comprehensive descriptive, diagnostic, and prescriptive analyses that delve into the data's narrative and offer actionable insights. 

I'd love for you to take a look and share your thoughts. Your feedback means a lot!
